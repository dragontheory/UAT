## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue** to report security vulnerabilities.
2. Instead, open a **private security advisory** by going to the repository's "Security" tab and selecting "Report a vulnerability."
3. Provide detailed information including steps to reproduce, logs, and affected version(s).
4. We will review and respond to the report within 72 hours with a timeline for resolution.

We encourage responsible disclosure and appreciate your assistance in keeping this project secure.
