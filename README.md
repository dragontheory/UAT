# User Acceptance Test (UAT)

User acceptance testing is the final testing stage in software development before production. It’s used to get feedback from users who test the software and its user interface (UI). UAT is usually done manually, with users creating real-world situations and testing how the software reacts and performs. Test-case scenarios can also be automated, simulating a user experience.

As its name suggests, UAT is used to determine if end-users accept software before it’s made public. Client or business requirements determine whether it fulfills the expectations originally set in its development.
